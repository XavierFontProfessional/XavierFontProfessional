# Hello there! I'm Xavier Font 👋

I'm a Creative Technologist with a passion for design, film, CGI, and development. My journey into the fascinating world of development started in 2020 when I found myself frustrated with the limitations of Wix. That frustration sparked curiosity, curiosity led to learning, and now I'm here, in love with the craft and a fervent enthusiast of the Linux ecosystem (yes, I use Gentoo)💻.

## About Me 🌍

- 🎬 My skills extend beyond the development world into Film/Video Filmmaking, with my work reaching over 2.6 million people globally.
- 🖥️ I've completed more than 12 design projects, with an emphasis on UI Design, and have written over 2 million lines of code as a Full-Stack Developer.

## Why such a low number of repos? 🧐

Over the past three years, I've ventured into numerous projects, each leaving behind a trail of repositories. However, not all of them were creations I found pride in. As someone who strongly identifies with minimalism, I chose to prune my GitHub garden, removing any repos that didn't resonate with the standard I aspire to uphold.

That said, some repositories were conceived in collaboration with others and were private from the outset. As I have parted ways with these projects, the power to publish these repositories now lies with my former collaborators. I respect their decisions and await the day these repositories can see the light of day.

You might notice a handful of incredibly simple repos that are currently published. These are not mistakes, but meticulously cherrypicked pieces from my journey. Each serves as a milestone, a nostalgia-inducing snapshot of my evolution into a full-stack developer. They remind me of the fun, the challenges, and the growth that this journey has entailed, like that quirky 'AlienJuan' one.

So, my GitHub is less about quantity and more about a carefully curated showcase of my growth, skills, and the fun I've had along the way.
