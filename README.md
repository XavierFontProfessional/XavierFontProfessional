# Hello there! I'm Xavier Font 👋

I'm a Creative Technologist with a passion for design, film, CGI, and development. My journey into the fascinating world of development started in 2020 when I found myself frustrated with the limitations of Wix. That frustration sparked curiosity, curiosity led to learning, and now I'm here, in love with the craft and a fervent enthusiast of the Linux ecosystem (yes, I use Gentoo)💻.

## About Me 🌍

- 🎬 My skills extend beyond the development world into Film/Video Filmmaking, with my work reaching over 2.6 million people globally.
- 🖥️ I've completed more than 12 design projects, with an emphasis on UI Design, and have written over 2 million lines of code as a Full-Stack Developer.
